53 108- ZAYDAN AuaMIN PREPARATION: To perform this ritual, you need to choose a night when the moon is waxing, which means it is growing bigger and brighter in the sky. This will increase your chances of success and attract positive energies. You also need to find a cemetery that has a cross-shaped monument or tombstone, which represents the four directions and elements. Before you leave your house, prepare some popcorn by heating oil and corn kernels in a pot over medium-high heat until they pop. This is a traditional offering for Pomba-Gira, a spirit of love, lust and power in Brazilian folk religion. HOW TO DO THE RITUAL: Gather all the materials you need and take them to the cemetery cross. When you arrive, greet the spirit of the place and ask for permission to use its space for your ritual. Explain your intention and promise to respect its rules. Then, lay a red towel on the ground in front of the cross. This is a symbol of passion and protection. On top of the towel, place a white plate with popcorn, which represents abundance and prosperity. Decorate it with red roses and ribbons, which are also symbols of love and attraction. Next, take a glass or cup and put seven metal buttons inside it. These are offerings for Exu, a trickster spirit who can open or close paths for you. Fill the glass with cachaÃ§a, a Brazilian liquor made from sugarcane, until it overflows on the ground. This is a sign of generosity and gratitude. Place the glass and bottle next to the plate with popcorn. Finally, light seven red candles around the towel, forming a circle. This creates a sacred space and invites Pomba-Gira and Exu to join you. Sing or recite a song or prayer dedicated to Pomba-Gira Queen of the Seven Crosses, one of her many manifestations. She is associated with cemeteries, crossroads and magic. Here is an example: In the seven Crosses She comes to greet With Exu to help me.

She is demanding at the crossroads. Greet Pomba-Gira of the Seven Crosses Greet beautiful brunette, Come here in this GongÃ¡ Because it runs without stopping Because it runs without stopping She is beautiful and comes to work.
  
When you finish singing or reciting, thank Pomba-Gira and Exu for their presence and assistance. Then, walk backwards seven steps, keeping your eyes on your ritual items. This shows respect and reverence for them. Do not look back or return to that place until your wish is fulfilled.
