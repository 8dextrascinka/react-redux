Vivah has received mixed reviews from different sources, with some praising it for its simplicity, innocence, and family values, while others criticizing it for its slow pace, lack of plot, and outdated portrayal of women.
 
According to IMDb, Vivah has a rating of 6.6 out of 10 based on 64 user reviews[^4^]. Some of the positive reviews highlight the film's charm, idealism, and chemistry between the lead actors. One user wrote: \"Its a charming, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect.\" Another user commented: \"The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME. Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship, Avoiding Courtship, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting for getting Married \"officially\", Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah.\"
 
However, some of the negative reviews point out the film's flaws, such as its lack of realism, originality, and entertainment value. One user wrote: \"The film has no story whatsoever and is just a plain and simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a vivah.\" Another user remarked: \"Vivah almost suffocates you with it's holier-than-thou attitude. More importantly, the film has no story whatsoever and is just a plain and simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a vivah.\"
 
According to Times of India, Vivah has a rating of 0 out of 5 based on 1 critic review. The review states that Vivah is a \"regressive\" film that \"serenades the small town girl once again as the epitome of virtues as opposed to the contrasexual cosmo gal.\" The review also criticizes the film's lack of story, dialogues, and performances. It says: \"The groom-to-be realises that he is always talking, oops murmuring, about himself. Why don't you tell me about yourself, about your feelings, your mindset, he asks his betrothed (Amrita Rao). Hm! Good observation. Well, the betrothed opens her eyes (yes, she keeps them closed whenever the guy talks to her), clears her throat and says: \"Today, while serving pakodas to chachaji, I felt like crying!\" That's the first time she talks about HER feelings. Need we say more.\"
 
According to Idlebrain.com, Vivah has a rating of 2 out of 5 based on 1 critic review. The review praises the film's climax and music but finds fault with its pace and direction. It says: \"Overall, Vivah is a pathetically slow film with a heart-rending climax. It is somewhat of a soap opera and the commercial success will depend largely on whether it will draw in family audiences in large numbers as his earlier films have in the past.\"
 
According to Bollywoodmantra.com, Vivah has a rating of 3 out of 5 based on 1 critic review. The review appreciates the film's simplicity and family entertainment but also acknowledges its drawbacks. It says: \"Overall Vivah does emerge as an average film that manages to do what it has set out to do which is make you laugh, cry and then finally emerge with a happily ever after good feeling. Vivah belongs to the genre of traditional love stories and has been directed and written by Sooraj Barjatya.\"

However, be warned that torrenting is illegal and can land you in trouble with the law. Therefore, we advise you to watch Vivah legally on streaming platforms or DVDs.
